Develop an IoT‑enabled AIR Quality Monitoring System utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller interfaced with multiple sensors—including SDS011 for particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), DHT11 for temperature and humidity, MQ‑7 for carbon monoxide detection, and MQ‑135 for general air‑quality monitoring. The system should upload real‑time sensor data to a cloud platform for remote monitoring and provide instant alert notifications when environmental parameters exceed predefined thresholds.
