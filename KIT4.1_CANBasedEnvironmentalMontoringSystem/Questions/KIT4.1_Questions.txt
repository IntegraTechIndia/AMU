Develop an IoT‑enabled, CAN‑based Environmental Monitoring System utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT11 temperature‑and‑humidity sensor. The system should send sensor data over the CAN bus using an MCP2515 CAN controller and support cloud‑based remote monitoring with real‑time alert notification capabilities.
