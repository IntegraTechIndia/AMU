Develop a program that uses an ESP32 to interface with the INA3221 three‑channel current and voltage monitor for real‑time battery monitoring applications.

Design and implement an IoT‑enabled EV Monitoring System based on the ESP32 microcontroller. The system should integrate: INA3221 for multi‑channel current and voltage monitoring, 10k NTC thermistor for motor or battery temperature measurement, MCP2515 CAN module for CAN bus communication, Relay module for protection or switching control. The application must acquire real‑time EV sensor data, transmit it over the CAN network through the MCP2515 controller, and forward it to a cloud platform for remote monitoring, analytics, and instant alert notifications when abnormal conditions are detected.
